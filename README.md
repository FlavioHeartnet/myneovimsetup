This is a Neovim setup based on [Kickstarter/](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) but with my preferencies of plugins and mapping
this is a repository to save my work and further imporviments in my Neovim setup.

Usage and Instalation: just follow exact the same step-by-step in the [Kickstarter/](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and it will do! ;)
